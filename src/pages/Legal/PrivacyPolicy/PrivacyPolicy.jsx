          <p>
            We collect information automatically when you use the Services,
            including when you browse our Site. To the extent you use certain
            features of the Site, such as the “Feedback” feature, we will
            collect the personal information that you provide us, which may
            include your email address or social media username.
          </p>
          <h3>Job applicants</h3>
          <p>
            When you submit a job application, we will collect your personal
            information. The categories of information we may collect include
            your full name, email address, phone number, resume, current and
            previous work history, and other information about you personally
            and your employment history.
          </p>
          <h3>Server logs</h3>
          <p>
            Server logs automatically record information and details about your
            online interactions with us. For example, server logs may record
            information about your visit to our Site on a particular time and
            day and collect information such as your device ID and IP address.
          </p>
          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            We also use cookies on the Services. Cookies are small files that
            are stored on your device through the Site. A cookie allows the
            Services to recognize whether you have visited before and may store
            user preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be
            used to collect or store information about your use of the Services
            during your current session and over time (including the pages you
            view and the files you download), your mobile device’s operating
            system, your IP address, and your general geographic location
          </p>
          <h3>Pixel tags</h3>
          <p>
            A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon, clear graphics interchange
            format (GIF), pixel, or tag) is an image or a small string of code
            that may be placed in an advertisement or email. It allows companies
            to set or read cookies or transfer information to their servers when
            you load a webpage or interact with online content. For example, our
            service providers may use pixel tags to determine whether you have
            interacted with a specific part of our Site.
          </p>
          <h3>Thirt-party plugins</h3>
          <p>
            Our Services may include plugins from other companies, including
            social media companies. These plugins may collect information, such
            as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the
            company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the
            plugin. These third-party plugins are governed by the privacy
            policies and terms of the companies that created them.
          </p>
          <h3>Thirt-party online tracking</h3>
          <p>
            We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyse,
            and use some of the personal and other information described in this
            section. For example, we may allow third parties to set pixels and
            mobile advertising IDs through the Site. This information may be
            used for a variety of purposes, including Site analytics, as
            discussed below (see the section entitled “With Whom and Why We
            Share Your Information”).
          </p>
          <h3>Aggregated and identified information</h3>
          <p>
            From time to time, we may also aggregate or identify information
            about your use of our Services, such as the pages you visit or your
            transactions, and share that information with third parties. Such
            aggregated information will not identify you personally.
